        STEP1- Prepare your materials and ingredients:
        Gather tools: measuring cups and spoons, an electric mixer (or whisk), a spatula, and an 8-inch cake pan.
         <br>
         <br>
        STEP2- Measure the dry ingredients:
       measure and whisk together 1 ½ cups (190g) all-purpose flour, 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder, and ¼ teaspoon salt.
      <br><br>
       STEP3-Soften the butter:
        Let ½ cup (115g) unsalted butter sit at room temperature until soft. This makes it easier to mix and results in a light, airy texture for your cake.
      <BR><BR>
       STEP4- Cream the butter and sugar:
        In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the softened butter with 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar.
       resulting in a soft, tender texture.
       <BR><BR>
        STEP5- Add eggs one at a time:
      that the eggs blend smoothly into the butter mixture without curdling.
        Stir in 1 ½ teaspoons of vanilla extract for flavor.<BR><BR>
       STEP6- Alternate dry ingredients and milk:
        Measure ½ cup (120ml) whole milk. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk.
       <BR><BR>
        STEP7- Mix until just combined:
        Use a spatula to gently fold the batter after mixing to make sure all ingredients are evenly combined.
       <BR><BR>
       STEP8-Transfer the batter to the cake pan:
        Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan. Use the spatula to spread it evenly across the pan, smoothing the top to ensure even baking.
         <BR><BR>
        STEP9- Bake the cake:
        Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes.
        the end of baking time to avoid over-baking, which can dry out the cake.<BR><BR>
        STEP10- Cool the cake:
        Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before carefully turning it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
